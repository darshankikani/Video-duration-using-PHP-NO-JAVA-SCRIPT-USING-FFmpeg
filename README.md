# Video-duration-using-PHP-NO-JAVA-SCRIPT-USING-FFmpeg
This is useful when you have to know how long video play  which is uploaded in your website without java script and using FFMPEG 
 If you do not have FFmpeg then download from their website or you can also use FFmpeg which is i upload on git hub 
 this folder you have to copy inside wamp64/www 
 create upload folder inside www and be carefull when you upload video because video namedo not contain space or any special caracter because when you run project it run cmd and special character or space define another command just start so always put name without space 
 Here i upload folder in two part becuse github only provide upto 25MB so download both folder and put it like shown below
